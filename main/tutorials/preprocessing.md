<h1 id="help-preprocessing-section">Data Builder</h1>

![Data Builder screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing.png)

The Data Builder makes new Data Blocks from existing ones. Its tools change which rows are present: every sub-tab creates a new child Data Block (made from another), and the source is never altered.

Tools that add or change columns (Combine columns, Count, Copy column, Extract text, Split column, Find & replace, Clean text) live in the [Data Editor](./ui.md#help-ui-data-viewer) below the Project Graph. They update the selected Data Block in place and never change the number or order of rows.

There are currently eight sub-tabs:

| Sub-tab | What it does | Apply behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Filter | Keep only the rows that match one or more conditions | New Data Block |
| Group | One Data Block per value, date period, or number range of a column | One new Data Block per group |
| Join | Combine two Data Blocks side-by-side on a shared column | New Data Block |
| Segment | One row per sentence, paragraph, line, or pattern-led segment, such as speaker turns | New Data Block |
| Aggregate | One row per group, such as one document per speaker, with a summary of each column | New Data Block |
| Sample | Extract a contiguous slice or a random subset of rows | New Data Block |
| Deduplicate | Keep the first of each duplicate, and save the duplicate groups separately | Two new Data Blocks |
| Stack | Put two or more Data Blocks that share the same columns one below the other | New Data Block |

The general workflow for any sub-tab is:

1. Add one or more Data Blocks under **Data Blocks**.
2. Configure the transformation.
3. Review the **Preview** table to check the expected output.
4. Click **Add to Project** (Group shows **Add N to Project** when N groups are ticked, one new Data Block per group; Deduplicate shows **Add 2 to Project**).

<h2 id="help-preprocessing-common-section">Common controls</h2>

These controls appear across multiple sub-tabs and work the same way throughout.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-common-node-selection">Data Block selection</h3>

Add Data Blocks under **Data Blocks** with **Add Data Block**, or with a Data Block's **+** button in the Data Blocks list or the Project Graph. Each sub-tab requires a specific number of Data Blocks: exactly two for Join, two to six for Stack, and one for the other tools. The heading shows how many are added out of the maximum (for example **1/1**), and **Add Data Block** is greyed out once the maximum is reached. Remove a Data Block with its **×**, or all of them with **Clear**. Segment, Aggregate, and Deduplicate also use the column chosen beside the Data Block (the **Text column**, or the **Deduplicating column** for Deduplicate).

![The Data Blocks panel with one Data Block and its text column](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/inputs_panel.png)

A topic coverage column (`TOPIC_coverage`, made by Topic Modelling) is not listed in the column choices of Group, Join, Segment, Aggregate, or Deduplicate, because these tools cannot read it yet. Filter, Group, Join, Sample, Stack, and Deduplicate still carry it into their results unchanged, and Filter can also keep rows by a topic threshold on it.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-common-preview">Preview table</h3>

The preview pane shows the result of the current configuration in a paginated format with an estimated row count. Check the preview before applying to confirm the output looks as expected. No Data Block is created until you click **Add to Project**.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-common-apply-button">Result destination</h3>

Every Data Builder tool creates new Data Blocks and never changes its sources: one for Filter, Join, Segment, Aggregate, Sample (including Slice, Random sample, and Shuffle), and Stack; one per ticked group for Group; and two for Deduplicate. The source is preserved and the new Data Block records its creation lineage.

To add or change columns on the selected Data Block instead, use the Data Editor. Its edits keep the Data Block's identity, graph edges, and rows unchanged, and each one can be undone from the Data Editor header.

<h2 id="help-preprocessing-filter-section">Filter</h2>

![Filter screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/filter.png)

The Filter sub-tab keeps only the rows that match defined conditions. Use it to remove noise, focus on a subset, or create a clean working Data Block before analysis.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-filter-conditions">Filter conditions</h3>

![Filter conditions screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/filter_conditions.png)

Define one or more column-based filter conditions. The behaviour of each condition depends on the data type of the selected column. All conditions are combined using either AND or OR logic (mixed logic chains are not supported).

- Click **Add condition** to add more conditions.
- Select **AND** or **OR** to control how conditions are combined.
- Check **Negate** on any individual condition to invert it.
- For a text column with the *contains* operator, tick **regular expression** to match a pattern instead of the exact text (see [Regular expressions](./ui.md#help-ui-regular-expressions)), and **case sensitive** to keep letter case distinct.
- When a selected column contains missing values, a warning reports how many.
  Ordinary filter conditions do not match those rows; choose **is empty** to
  target them explicitly. **is empty** matches missing values, NaN, and text
  that is empty or only spaces; tick **Negate** for "is not empty".
- The preview shows how many rows the current condition set would keep. An empty result is possible if no rows satisfy the conditions or if conditions conflict.
- Category values load in ordered pages. Scroll to load more, use search to
  filter on the server, and use **Select all** to select every value listed so
  far (values not loaded yet are not selected), or **Select none** to clear
  them. Existing selections remain selected across searches.
- In a value list, missing values are listed as **(empty)** and text that is
  empty or only spaces as **(blank text)**.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-filter-new-node-name">New Data Block name</h3>

![Filter new Data Block name screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/filter_new_node_name.png)

Give the filtered output a descriptive name so it is easy to find in the Project. The new Data Block is a child of the selected source Data Block.

**Practice exercise**

1. Select a Data Block with a clear category column.
2. Add a condition that keeps only one category.
3. Add the filtered result as a new Data Block and confirm the row count in the preview.

<h2 id="help-preprocessing-slice-section">Sample</h2>

![Sample screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/sample.png)

The Sample sub-tab extracts either a contiguous range or a randomly selected set of rows. A small representative subset makes exploring and debugging quicker than working with the full Data Block.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-slice-offset">Slice: start row and length</h3>

![Slice screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/sample_slice.png)

The slice option extracts a contiguous chunk of rows. **Start row** sets the first row to include (0 means the first row) and **Length** sets how many rows to include. Leave Length blank to slice to the end of the Data Block. For example, to extract rows 101–200 set Start row = 100 and Length = 100.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-slice-length">Length</h3>

The number of rows to be sliced from the start row. Leave blank to slice from the start row to the end of the Data Block.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-sample-fraction">Random sample: fraction or count</h3>

![Random screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/sample_random.png)

The random sample option extracts a randomly selected set of rows.

- **Fraction**: enter a decimal between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.3 for 30 % of rows).
- **Count**: enter a whole number of rows to extract (e.g. 500). If the count exceeds the Data Block size, all rows are returned in shuffled order.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-sample-seed">Random seed</h3>

The random seed controls reproducibility. Using the same seed on the same data always produces the same rows.

- Use any non-negative integer (e.g. 0).
- Check **No random seed** to draw a truly random sample. Note that this makes the sample irreproducible and the randomness propagates to all child Data Blocks made from it.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-slice-new-node-name">New Data Block name</h3>

The pre-populated name includes the sampling parameters. Edit it if you need a more descriptive label. Sample is create-only.

**Practice exercise**

1. Select a Data Block with at least 200 rows.
2. Try Slice with Start row 50 and Length 25, then try Random sample with Fraction 0.2 and a fixed seed.
3. Add each result as a new Data Block and compare the row counts.

<h2 id="help-preprocessing-join-section">Join</h2>

![Join screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/join.png)

The Join sub-tab combines two Data Blocks side-by-side using matching columns. Use it when your text data is in one Data Block and metadata is in another, or when you need to enrich a Data Block before analysis. The result includes all columns from both Data Blocks, making it wider than either source.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-join-column-picker">Join column picker</h3>

![Join column picker screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/join_column_picker.png)

Choose which column to match in each Data Block. The app pre-populates the most likely shared columns, but you are responsible for selecting the correct joining columns. Use clean, consistent identifier columns for the best results.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-join-type">Join type</h3>

Join type controls how unmatched rows are handled. The first Data Block you add is the left Data Block, and the second is the right Data Block. The explanation of the chosen type appears beside the selector.

![Join type selector with the explanation of Left](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/join_type.png)

![The six join types](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/join_type_menu.png)

| Type | Keeps |
|---|---|
| Left (default) | Every row of the left Data Block, with matching values from the right; rows without a match get empty cells |
| Inner | Only rows that match in both Data Blocks |
| Right | Every row of the right Data Block, with matching values from the left; rows without a match get empty cells |
| Full | Every row of both Data Blocks, matched where possible; missing values are left empty |
| Keep matches | Left rows that have a match in the right, without adding any right columns (for example, speeches whose speaker is in a list) |
| Keep non-matches | Left rows with no match in the right (for example, dropping documents listed in another Data Block) |

When both Data Blocks have a column with the same name, the right Data Block's copy is named after that Data Block, for example `speaker_members` when the right Data Block is `members`.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-join-node-name">Join output name</h3>

Give the joined output a clear name. Leave it blank to use the auto-generated suggestion. Join is create-only.

**Practice exercise**

1. Select two Data Blocks that share an identifier column.
2. Pick that column in both column pickers and run an Inner join.
3. Compare the row count in the preview against both source Data Blocks.

<h2 id="help-preprocessing-concat-section">Stack</h2>

![Stack screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/concat.png)

The Stack sub-tab puts two or more Data Blocks one below the other. Use it when you want to merge Data Blocks with identical column structures into one longer Data Block.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-concat-schema-status">Column check</h3>

![Column check screenshot](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/concat_schema_status.png)

The **Column check** panel tells you whether all the Data Blocks share the same columns. If they don't, **These columns don't match** lists, for each Data Block, the columns it is missing, the extra columns it has, and any column whose type is different. Fix the column differences (e.g. by renaming or removing columns) before stacking.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-concat-deduplicate">Deduplicate</h3>

Tick **Deduplicate**, beside **Add to Project**, to keep one copy of rows that are the same in every column of the stacked result. Two rows count as duplicates only when every column matches. Useful when stacking sources that may share overlapping records (e.g. partial dumps of the same dataset). To compare only some columns, or to keep a record of the duplicates, use [Deduplicate](#help-preprocessing-dedupe-section) on the stacked result instead.

<h3 id="help-preprocessing-concat-new-node-name">New Data Block name</h3>

Provide a label for the stacked output. Leave it blank to use the auto-generated suggestion. Stack is create-only.

**Practice exercise**

1. Select two Data Blocks with the same column structure.
2. Check the **Column check** panel to confirm the columns match.
3. Add the stacked result and confirm the row count equals the sum of both sources.

<h2 id="help-preprocessing-segment-section">Segment</h2>

Segment makes a new Data Block with one row per segment of the text column chosen in the inputs panel. Each segment keeps its source row's other columns, and a **segment** column counts the segments within each source row from 1, so you can trace every segment back.

- **Sentences** end at `.`, `!`, `?`, or `…` followed by a space. A sentence keeps its own punctuation. This is a simple rule, so abbreviations such as "Dr. Smith" also end a sentence, and it can differ slightly from Topic Modelling's sentence option.
- **Paragraphs** are separated by a blank line.
- **Lines** split at every line break.
- **A pattern** is a [regular expression](./ui.md#help-ui-regular-expressions) marking where each segment starts; `^` means the start of a line. For a transcript written as `JOHN SMITH: Hello`, the pattern `^[\w\s]+:` starts a segment at each speaker. Choose whether the matched text **goes into its own column** (for example *speaker*, with the trailing colon removed) or **is dropped, like a delimiter**. Text before the first match becomes segment 1.

The count below the choices (for example **5,885 segment rows**) shows how many rows the new Data Block will have.

![Segment choices for the text column, with Sentences selected](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/segment_methods.png)

With **A pattern** selected, type the pattern and choose what happens to the matched text. Here each re-post of the form `RT @user:` starts a segment, and the matched text goes into a new column named `retweet_of`:

![Segment with a pattern whose matched text goes into its own column](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/segment_pattern.png)

Separators are not kept, segments are trimmed, and empty segments are skipped.

<h2 id="help-preprocessing-split-group-section">Group</h2>

Group makes one Data Block per group of a column (not to be confused with Aggregate, which makes one row per group), so analyses that compare Data Blocks need one step instead of several filters.

Choose the column under **Split by**; the choices below it depend on the column's type.

- For **text** and **category** columns, each value is a group. Values are listed with their row counts, most frequent first.
- For **dates**, group by year, year and month, or day.
- For **numbers**, use ranges of a fixed size from a start value, or split the full range into a number of equal ranges.

![Group by party, with three small groups unticked](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/group_values.png)

![Group by a date column, one Data Block per year and month](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/group_dates.png)

Every group starts ticked; untick any you don't need, or use **Select all** and **Select none**. The button shows how many Data Blocks will be made. Each Data Block is a Filter of the source, named like `speeches · Labor`; change the first part of the names under **New Data Block names**. At most 50 Data Blocks are made at a time. If a column has more groups, narrow the data first, for example with Filter.

<h2 id="help-preprocessing-summarise-section">Aggregate</h2>

Aggregate makes a new Data Block with one row per group, for example one document per speaker. Choose one or more **group by** columns, then a summary for each other column:

- Text: **Join text**, **Count distinct**, **Distinct values**, **First**, **Last**
- Numbers: **Sum**, **Mean**, **Minimum**, **Maximum**, **Count distinct**, **First**, **Last**
- Dates: **Earliest & latest**, **Earliest**, **Latest**, **Count distinct**, **First**, **Last**

The defaults are cautious. The text column chosen in the inputs panel is joined, with a blank line between texts (change this under **Put between joined texts**). Dates keep their earliest and latest values. Every other column starts as **Leave out**, so ids are never joined or summed by surprise. A **rows** column always counts the rows in each group. Groups appear in the order they first occur. Use **Find a column** to find a column in a long list.

![Aggregate grouped by username, with a summary chosen for each column](tutorials/assets/preprocessing/aggregate.png)

<h2 id="help-preprocessing-dedupe-section">Deduplicate</h2>

Deduplicate makes two Data Blocks and never changes the source:

1. `…_deduplicated` keeps the first row of each set of duplicates, in the original order.
2. `…_duplicates` holds every row that has a duplicate, including the kept one, with a **duplicate_group** number and a **kept** column, so you can check what matched.

Choose the **Deduplicating column** in the inputs panel: rows are always compared on it. Tick any **Additional columns to include** so rows must match on those too, or use **Select all** to compare whole rows. When the deduplicating column holds text, tick **Match near-duplicate text** to compare it after ignoring case, spacing, and punctuation. You can also ignore web links and @mentions, so a re-post such as `RT @user: Save the reef!` matches `save the reef`. The preview reports how many rows would be removed.
