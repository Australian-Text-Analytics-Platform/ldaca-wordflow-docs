<h2 id="info-sequential-analysis-overview">About Trends Analysis</h2>

- What is this?

If your text collection includes dates as metadata, this tool allows you to see how many texts were created on each date, creating a timeline visualisation. You can also do a Trends analysis for texts produced by a particular group of speakers/authors if you have additional metadata, for example showing how the texts of younger vs older speakers are distributed over time. You can include up to 3 different metadata categories in this timeline visualisation. Please note the total number of groups is the product of all selected categories, therefore this can get overwhelmingly large for the visualisation.

You can also use this tool to identify how one or more particular words occur across time, as long as the words are extracted as a metadata column (e.g. using the Concordance tab).

Besides datetime data, the user can also choose to use any numeric data as the X axis, this can be used to show different statistical information. For example, if the word count of documents is available as a metadata, selecting word count as X-axis generates histogram of the text lengths in a collection.


- What do I need to know before using this?
Your textual data should be consistently encoded (UTF8) and should not contain any xml tags. If necessary, you can use the Data Editor (Clean text, Remove HTML tags or Remove XML tags and markup) to remove any content within angle brackets.

You need to make sure that the column that includes the date is correctly classified (not as text, but as datetime, date, integer or decimal). You can convert it with the data-type menu in its column header in the Data Editor. For additional metadata (e.g. gender, age, political party) it is a good idea to convert these columns to categorical in the same way.

For visualising words on the timeline: You first have to create a Concordance,
open Review in **Table view**, and use **Add to Project** to save the matches as a new
Data Block. Include the date and any other metadata that
you need. Then use that Data Block as the source for Trends and add
`CONC_matched_text` (text) as a Group By column. This shows how each exact
matched term occurs over time. To count case variants such as *Jobs* and *jobs*
together, tick **Ignore capitals** beside the result legend.

- Can I change any of the settings/parameters?
You can change the frequency (e.g. daily vs monthly), you can change the chart type for the visualisation, and you can add parameters (based on metadata) for the comparison (Add Group). You can change which parameters are visible and which are not visible in the timeline. When numerical data is selected, you can decide the interval where the origin to start for the X-axis (not necessarily starting from Zero).

You can also create a new Data Block from the original source rows. Use click
or drag selection to choose periods, hide any groups you do not want, and then
choose **Add to Project**. With no selected periods, all periods are included;
chart zoom does not affect the new Data Block.

- Is there a notebook version?
There was a preliminary notebook version of this concept on this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/atap-corpus-timeline), however this visualisation works the best with various filtering/extracting/creating tools as an integration.
