<h1 id="info-topic-modeling-overview">About Topic Modelling</h1>

Topic modelling is an exploratory way to find recurring language patterns in a
large collection without reading every document first. Wordflow groups similar
text and summarises each group with statistically representative words.

The unit processed by the model is a **Topic Segment**. Depending on your
segmentation setting, one source document can contribute one or many Topic
Segments. Wordflow embeds and clusters the segments, then combines their topic
assignments into source-character Topic Coverage for the source document.

<h3 id="info-topic-modeling-pipeline">How the result is produced</h3>

1. Automatic, Paragraph, or Sentence segmentation creates non-overlapping Topic Segments.
2. A sentence-transformer model converts each segment into an embedding.
3. PaCMAP reduces the embeddings and HDBSCAN discovers natural clusters and
   outliers.
4. Wordflow builds a deterministic cosine average-linkage tree over real Topics.
5. Class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) ranks representative words for each topic.
6. Segment assignments are rolled up to document-level Topic Coverage, weighted
   by the Unicode-character length owned by each segment.

For keyword extraction, c-TF-IDF combines all Topic Segments assigned to a
topic into one class-level text. The configured vectoriser tokenises that text
and removes applicable stopwords. A term receives a high score when it occurs
often within that topic but is less common across the other topics. The highest
scoring terms become the representative words. They describe distinctive
vocabulary, not necessarily the topic's meaning or an author's intent.

<h3 id="info-topic-modeling-segmentation">Why segmentation matters</h3>

Automatic segmentation starts from paragraphs (blank-line blocks, or single lines
when the text has no blank lines), Paragraph from each non-empty line, and
Sentence from Unicode sentence boundaries. A unit that fits the model budget is
one segment; an oversized unit is split into sentences and then at the clause
punctuation nearest its middle, so segments end at natural pauses rather than
leaving tiny fragments. Every source span is owned by at most one segment, so
coverage is never repeated.

<h3 id="info-topic-modeling-what-you-can-do">What you can do</h3>

- Explore prominent and niche language patterns.
- Compare the contribution of two corpora to the same discovered topics.
- Adjust the displayed number of real Topics from the natural fit down to one.
- Count each row in bubbles for its strongest one or more positive Topics.
- Inspect representative words, topic sizes, similarity, and outliers.
- Pan and zoom the fitted Topic graph, or cumulatively lasso Topics to filter
  the All Topics list.
- Add selected topic data and meanings to the Project as new Data Blocks.

<h3 id="info-topic-modeling-interpretation">Interpret with care</h3>

Topic modelling is not a classifier or a definitive account of what a corpus
is “about”. Clusters can reflect subject matter, genre, author, boilerplate,
document length, or data-cleaning artefacts. Topic −1 is the expected outlier
group rather than an error. Sampling, segmentation, Min and Max topic size, the
displayed number of topics, and the random seed can all affect the result, so
compare configurations and return to the source documents when naming or
interpreting a topic.

Min topic size controls the smallest number of Topic Segments that can
form a natural HDBSCAN Topic during the initial run. Its default is 10 and its
minimum is 2. Changing it requires a new run and may change the maximum natural
Topic count. Max topic size limits the largest Topic; its Auto default only steps
in when one Topic would hold more than half of all Topic Segments.

The Number of topics Result control merges HDBSCAN's natural real Topics; it
does not rerun the model and cannot split above that natural count. Topic −1 is
never counted or merged. After each change Wordflow recalculates representative
words, coordinates, and document assignments.

Top topics per document defaults to two. A bubble counts a source row when that
Topic has a positive share among the row's strongest N real-topic shares.
Outlier −1 and zero shares do not count; ties at the cutoff all count. A row can
therefore contribute to several bubbles, and bubble totals can exceed the
number of source rows. Changing only Top N updates counts without changing the
map layout or clearing graph interactions.

The term *topic* is technical rather than authorial. A critical overview is
available in [this open-access article](https://doi.org/10.1177/14614456241293075)
and its expert commentaries. A notebook using a different stochastic block
model approach is available in [topsbm](https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/topsbm).
